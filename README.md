    - On Donation Cart when you add a product, the Total and Quantity Says "NaN,
     if you click "+" and refresh the page. The total and quantity will work

     - On Donation Cart, sometimes when you go to the page it won't load but if you
     refresh the page it works

     - If you switch back and forth from My Cart and Donation Cart, it will not show
     the logged in Cart anymore. It seems like you have to use one cart at a time. Or 
     if you log back in, the Cart comes back

  Errors: Working on errors..! I have an idea of
  the solution just need to keep working it out.
