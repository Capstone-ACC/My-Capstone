  Errors: I will definitely work on and try to fix. I think I know
  the solution just need to keep working it out. 

     - On Donation Cart when you add a product, the Total and Quantity Says "NaN,
     if you click "+" and refresh the page. The total and quantity will work

     - On Donation Cart, sometimes when you go to the page it won't load but if you
     refresh the page it works

     - If you switch back and forth from My Cart and Donation Cart, it will not show
     the logged in Cart anymore. It seems like you have to use one cart at a time. Or 
     if you log back in, the Cart comes back
