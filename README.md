#Tech & Styles Capstone Final Project

This is my Capstone Project for Fullstack Academy. Using the Fake Store API, I was able to build a stylish E-Commerce Site where customers can come and buy clothes and accessories.

#Built With

- React.js
- CSS

Inspired from the Dillard's website I was able to build a stylish website where you can filter out exactly what you are looking for and a smooth checkout process. It was a lot of fun to build, I learned a lot, when it comes to setting up a React.js project, to reuseable components, React Router, passing down props, useContext, filtering, and mobile responsiveness. Had fun this project and made it my own.
