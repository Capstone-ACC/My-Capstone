#Capstone Project, Fullstack Academy

This is my capstone for Fullstack Academy. Using the Fake Store API, I was able to build a stylish E-Commerce Site. It was a lot of fun to build, learned a lot, when it comes to reuseable components, useContext, filtering, and mobile responsiveness.

Deployed Site: 'https://style-your-tech.netlify.app/'
